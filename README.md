Hello and thank you for considering me!

I chose to use reactjs primarily because I am already familiar with it. I favor it in cases like this because I know I'll be using databases (in this case Firestore)
and since JS already part of reactjs, I figured I'd have no trouble integrating Firestore.

There are a lot of improvements I would like to make to the website:
  1) I had so many ideas for the UI that I just could not implement in the time frame. I wanted dynamic backgrounds, chat boxes for the messages, a better contact list (that is actually scrollable),
     and would have liked the to make the whole website look less html-esque.
  2) I think I could have handled data transfer a lot better, make it more confidential and more efficient. There are a few gimmicks I used to get everything to work that I wish I didn't need
  3) I also wanted to make my website handle page changes better, ie; not using href
  4) I could have made the mobile version look better by crafting the website through flexboxes
  
There is one main thing I would have liked to do differently. I initially started out trying to use redux and my own linker (I even set them both up), but working with them proved to be difficult
and ultimately I decided to stick to the basics. I believe redux is super powerful and I couldn't quite take advantage of it. Less importantly however, I think using flexboxes would have been better
than using screen dimensions. I ussually always use flexboxes but in this case, because it takes me a while to draw out conceptually what I want the boxes to be, I went for the much faster approach of 
screen dimensions.
